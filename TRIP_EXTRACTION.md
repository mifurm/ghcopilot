## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from trip_extractor import extract_trip_details, format_trip_summary

# Extract all details
message = "I want to go to Paris in June with my wife and 2 kids aged 5 and 8"
details = extract_trip_details(message)

# Get a formatted summary
summary = format_trip_summary(details)
print(summary)
```

**Output:**
```
📋 Extracted Trip Details:
📍 Destination: Paris
📅 Month: June
👶 Children: 2
🎈 Children Ages: 5, 8
```

### Individual Extractors

```python
from trip_extractor import extract_destination, extract_dates, extract_travelers

# Extract just the destination
destination = extract_destination("Trip to Tokyo")
# Returns: "Tokyo"

# Extract just dates
dates = extract_dates("June 15 to June 20")
# Returns: {'start_date': '2025-06-15', 'end_date': '2025-06-20', ...}

# Extract just travelers
travelers = extract_travelers("2 adults and 3 children")
# Returns: {'adults': 2, 'children': 3, 'total': 5}
```

### Using the Class Directly

```python
from trip_extractor import TripDetailsExtractor

extractor = TripDetailsExtractor()

# Extract all details
details = extractor.extract_all_details("Message here")

# Use individual methods
destination = extractor.extract_destination("Going to Paris")
dates = extractor.extract_dates("June 15 to 20")
travelers = extractor.extract_travelers("Family of 4")
duration = extractor.extract_duration("5 day trip")
children = extractor.extract_children("Kids aged 5 and 8")
```

## 🔍 Pattern Recognition

### Destination Patterns

```python
# Pattern examples that work:
"to Paris"              → Paris
"visit London"          → London
"visiting Tokyo"        → Tokyo
"trip to New York"      → New York
"in Barcelona"          → Barcelona
"going to France"       → France
```

### Date Patterns

```python
# Specific dates:
"June 15"               → 2025-06-15
"15th of June"          → 2025-06-15
"June 15 to June 20"    → start: 2025-06-15, end: 2025-06-20

# Seasons:
"next summer"           → season: summer
"winter trip"           → season: winter

# Relative:
"next week"             → relative: next_week
"next month"            → relative: next_month
```

### Traveler Patterns

```python
# Explicit counts:
"2 adults"              → adults: 2
"3 children"            → children: 3
"2 adults and 3 kids"   → adults: 2, children: 3

# Family:
"family of 4"           → total: 4
"family of five"        → total: 5

# Couples:
"me and my wife"        → adults: 2
"my husband and I"      → adults: 2

# Solo:
"solo trip"             → adults: 1
"traveling alone"       → adults: 1
```

### Duration Patterns

```python
# Days:
"5 days"                → 5
"5-day trip"            → 5
"five days"             → 5

# Weeks:
"2 weeks"               → 14
"one week"              → 7
```

## 🎯 Integration with Flask App

The trip extractor is integrated into the main Flask app in two ways:

### 1. Automatic Extraction (Built-in)

When you send a message through the chat, trip details are automatically extracted and appended to the AI response:

```python
# In app.py - automatically happens
def generate_response(message):
    # Extract trip details
    trip_details = extract_trip_details(message)
    
    # Get AI response
    response = get_azure_ai_response(message, history)
    
    # Append extracted details if found
    if has_trip_info:
        response += format_trip_summary(trip_details)
    
    return response
```

### 2. API Endpoint

You can also call the extraction directly via API:

```bash
# Test the extraction endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/extract-details \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Trip to Paris in June with 2 kids"}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "details": {
    "destination": "Paris",
    "dates": {"month": "June"},
    "travelers": {"children": 2},
    ...
  },
  "summary": "📋 Extracted Trip Details:\n📍 Destination: Paris\n..."
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Run the Test Suite

```bash
python trip_extractor.py
```

This runs 6 test cases covering various scenarios:
- Family trip with children
- Specific date ranges
- Season-based planning
- Adult and child counts
- Solo travel
- Duration extraction

### Example Test Output

```
======================================================================
Test 1: I want to plan a trip to Paris with my wife and two kids aged 5 and 8
======================================================================
📋 Extracted Trip Details:
📍 Destination: Paris
👨👩 Adults: 2
👶 Children: 2
🎈 Children Ages: 5, 8
```

## 🔧 Extending the Extractor

### Adding New Destinations

```python
# In trip_extractor.py
self.destinations = [
    'paris', 'london', 'tokyo',  # Existing
    'singapore', 'dubai', 'cairo',  # Add your cities
    'thailand', 'vietnam', 'morocco'  # Add your countries
]
```

### Adding Custom Patterns

```python
# Add to extract_destination method
pattern_custom = r'heading to\s+([a-z\s]+)'
match = re.search(pattern_custom, message_lower)
if match:
    destination = match.group(1).strip()
    return destination.title()
```

### Adding Budget Extraction

```python
def extract_budget(self, message: str) -> Optional[Dict]:
    """Extract budget information"""
    message_lower = message.lower()
    
    # Pattern: "$5000 budget"
    pattern = r'\$(\d+(?:,\d{3})*)'
    match = re.search(pattern, message)
    if match:
        amount = int(match.group(1).replace(',', ''))
        return {'amount': amount, 'currency': 'USD'}
    
    return None
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Custom Summary Format

```python
def custom_format(details):
    """Create your own format"""
    parts = []
    
    if details['destination']:
        parts.append(f"Going to: {details['destination']}")
    
    if details['travelers']['total'] > 0:
        parts.append(f"Party size: {details['travelers']['total']}")
    
    return " | ".join(parts)
```

### Combine with AI for Enhanced Extraction

```python
# Use AI to fill in missing details
if not details['destination']:
    # Ask Azure AI to infer the destination
    ai_response = get_azure_ai_response(
        f"Extract the destination from: {message}"
    )
```

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Destination Database**: Only recognizes pre-defined destinations. Can be expanded.

2. **Date Ambiguity**: "June" could be 2025 or 2026. Current implementation assumes current/next year.

3. **Context Dependency**: "We're 4" requires previous context to know it means travelers.

4. **Language**: Currently only supports English.

5. **Complex Phrases**: May miss details in very complex sentences.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] ML-based entity recognition
- [ ] Budget extraction
- [ ] Activity preferences extraction
- [ ] Accommodation type extraction
- [ ] Transportation preferences
- [ ] Dietary restrictions
- [ ] Context-aware extraction (remember previous messages)
- [ ] Fuzzy destination matching
- [ ] Integration with location APIs (geocoding)

## 💡 Tips

1. **Be Specific**: The more details in the message, the better the extraction
2. **Use Numbers**: "2 adults" works better than "couple"
3. **Explicit Dates**: "June 15" works better than "mid-June"
4. **Test First**: Run `python trip_extractor.py` to see examples
