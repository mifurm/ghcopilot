# Azure AI Configuration Issue - Resolution

## üîç Problem Identified

You received the message "Azure AI is not configured" due to **two issues**:

### Issue 1: Incorrect Endpoint Format ‚ùå

**What you had:**
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://micha-mgfndxjq-northcentralus.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4o/chat/completions?api-version=2025-01-01-preview"
```

**Problem:** The endpoint included the complete API path with deployment name and query parameters.

**What it should be:**
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://micha-mgfndxjq-northcentralus.openai.azure.com/
```

**Why:** The Azure OpenAI SDK automatically constructs the full path using:
- Base endpoint
- Deployment name (from `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`)
- API version (from `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`)

### Issue 2: OpenAI SDK Version Compatibility ‚ùå

**Problem:** OpenAI SDK version 1.52.0 had a bug with the `proxies` parameter initialization.

**Error message:**
```
Client.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'proxies'
```

**Solution:** Upgraded to OpenAI SDK 2.2.0

```bash
pip install --upgrade openai
```

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. Corrected Endpoint URL

**Before:**
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://micha-mgfndxjq-northcentralus.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4o/chat/completions?api-version=2025-01-01-preview"
```

**After:**
```env
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://micha-mgfndxjq-northcentralus.openai.azure.com/
```

**Key changes:**
- ‚úÖ Removed `/openai/deployments/gpt-4o/chat/completions`
- ‚úÖ Removed query parameter `?api-version=...`
- ‚úÖ Removed surrounding quotes
- ‚úÖ Added trailing slash

### 2. Upgraded OpenAI Package

```bash
# Before
openai==1.52.0

# After
openai==2.2.0
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

Updated `azure_ai.py` to handle version compatibility issues with fallback initialization.

## üìã Your Correct Configuration

Here's what's working now in your `.env`:

```env
# Base endpoint URL only
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://micha-mgfndxjq-northcentralus.openai.azure.com/

# Your API key (kept secure)
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=3Zd88BEwhd2dYWQOZyFnzt4r0gQkeRPLrxizJDp9ZuCeekp6e1GgJQQJ99BJACHrzpqXJ3w3AAAAACOGIvD0

# API version
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-12-01-preview

# Deployment name (not in the endpoint!)
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o

# Model reference
AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o

# Response settings
AZURE_OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.7
AZURE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=1000

# Enable Azure AI
USE_AZURE_AI=true
```

---

## üéØ How The SDK Constructs The Full URL

The Azure OpenAI SDK takes your configuration and builds the complete URL:

```python
# Your config:
endpoint = "https://micha-mgfndxjq-northcentralus.openai.azure.com/"
deployment = "gpt-4o"
api_version = "2024-12-01-preview"

# SDK constructs:
full_url = f"{endpoint}openai/deployments/{deployment}/chat/completions?api-version={api_version}"

# Result:
# https://micha-mgfndxjq-northcentralus.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/gpt-4o/chat/completions?api-version=2024-12-01-preview
```

This is why you only need the **base endpoint** in the `.env` file!

## üöÄ Next Steps

Your Azure AI integration is now fully functional! You can:

### 1. Run the Flask App
```bash
python app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:5000

### 2. Test with Chat
Send messages like:
- "I want to plan a trip to Paris"
- "Suggest kid-friendly activities in Tokyo"
- "What's the best time to visit Italy with children?"

### 3. Monitor Usage
- Check Azure Portal ‚Üí Your AI resource ‚Üí Metrics
- Monitor token usage and costs
- Set up budget alerts if needed

---

## üí° Key Learnings

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use **base endpoint URL only** (ends with `.azure.com/`)
- Keep deployment name in `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`
- Use latest OpenAI SDK version
- Remove quotes from .env values (unless they contain spaces)
- Add trailing slash to endpoint

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Include deployment path in endpoint
- Include query parameters in endpoint
- Use old OpenAI SDK versions (< 1.30.0)
- Commit `.env` file to Git
- Share API keys publicly

## üîí Security Reminder

**Your API key is now visible in this document!**

Consider:
1. **Regenerating your API key** in Azure Portal if this file is shared
2. **Never commit** `.env` to version control
3. **Use Azure Key Vault** for production deployments
4. **Set up budget alerts** to avoid unexpected costs

To regenerate:
1. Go to Azure Portal
2. Navigate to your Azure OpenAI resource
3. Go to "Keys and Endpoint"
4. Click "Regenerate Key"
5. Update your `.env` file
